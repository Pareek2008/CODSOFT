# CODSOFT AI Internship – Python Projects 💻

This repository contains 3 projects completed as part of the **CodSoft AI Internship (June 2025 Batch)**. Each task demonstrates fundamental and advanced concepts in Artificial Intelligence using Python.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## ✅ Task 1: KeshBot - Personalized Rule-based Chatbot 🤖

**KeshBot** is a terminal-based chatbot developed using Python. It interacts with users through a set of personalized questions and handles basic NLP-style responses.

### 🔍 Features:

* Asks for user's name, mood, goals, hobbies, and preferences
* Responds to common inputs like "your name", "who made you", "help", "bye"
* Handles unexpected input with fallback messages
* Uses slow typing effect for a more realistic chat experience

### ⚖️ Technologies Used:

* Python
* `time`, `random` modules
* Functions, loops, conditionals, input/output

### ▶️ How to Run:

```bash
python Task1.py
```

## ✅ Task 2: Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm) 🎮

This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where the user plays against an **unbeatable AI** using the **Minimax Algorithm**.

### 🧠 Core Logic:

* Human player uses `X`, AI uses `O`
* AI evaluates all possible moves recursively to find the optimal one
* Uses backtracking and recursion to minimize user winning chances

### ⚖️ Technologies Used:

* Python
* Minimax algorithm (via recursion)
* 3x3 matrix for board representation

### ▶️ How to Run:

```bash
python Task2.py
```

## ✅ Task 3: Smart Recommendation System (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity) 📊

A content-based recommendation system that provides intelligent suggestions based on **text similarity** between user input and available data using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.

### 🔍 Features:

* Accepts free-text input from user (e.g., "AI in healthcare")
* Converts descriptions into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
* Calculates similarity scores and recommends top 3 matches

### ⚖️ Technologies Used:

* Python
* `pandas`, `scikit-learn` (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)

### ▶️ How to Run:

```bash
python Task3.py
```
